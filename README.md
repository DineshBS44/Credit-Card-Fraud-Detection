# Credit Card and Bank Transaction Fraud Detection

- In this project, we aim to use Machine learning algorithms to detect the frauds happening in Credit Card and Bank transactions.
- Python is used to create, train and test the model because it has the biggest developer community with a lot of inbuilt libraries to handle complex mathematical operations used in these ML Models.
